# cheqd: Credentials Service

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

The purpose of this package is to connect the Veramo SDK for cheqd to cheqd's demo web-app ([wallet.cheqd.io](https://wallet.cheqd.io/welcome)). 

Using this package, users are able to provide a way in which a wallet holder can request a JSON credential (JWT proofed) and hold this in a web-app.

We have offered this as a reference implementation of how someone may utilise the cheqd and veramo packages on a web application.

For our implementation we used:

* Cloudflare
* Auth0
* IPFS storage

See below for a diagram of our reference implementation:
