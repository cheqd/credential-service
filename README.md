## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

The purpose of this service is to issue and verify credentials. This service by itself does not take care of storing the credentials. If you'd like to store credentials, you would have to pair this service with [secret-box-service](https://github.com/cheqd/secret-box-service.git). This service is also dependent on [auth0-service](https://github.com/cheqd/auth0-service)

## üìñ Endpoints

### Issue a credential

- **Endpoint** POST `/api/credentials/issue`
- **Accepts**: `application/json`
- **Request Body**: JSON object with following fields
  - `claim` - Claim received from the Auth0 Service
  - `provider` - Auth0 login provider (eg: Twitter, Discord, Github, etc)
  - `subjectId` - ID of the holder of the credential
- **Success Response Code**: 200
- **Error Response Code** - 400

### Verify a Credential

- **Endpoint** POST `/api/credentials/verify`
- **Accepts**: `application/json`
- **Request Body**: JSON object with following fields:
  - `credential` - A verifiable credential
- **Success Response Code** - 200
- **Error Response Codes**:
  - 400: Bad request body
  - 405: Wrong content type

### Health Check

- **Endpoint**: `/api/credentials` (This endpoint only returns a "PONG" as response with status code 200)

## üßë‚Äçüíªüõ† Developer Guide

### Setup

Dependencies can be installed using NPM or any other node package manager.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Configuration

The application expects the following environment variables to be defined for the app to function:

1. `ISSUER_ID_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX`: Hex-encoded private key to be used by the identity credential issuer
2. `ISSUER_ID_PUBLIC_KEY_HEX`: Hex-encoded public key to be used by the identity credential issuer
3. `ISSUER_ID_KID`: Key ID to match a specific key inside a JWK
4. `ISSUER_ID_METHOD`: `did:cheqd` method along with network namespace (e.g., `did:cheqd:mainnet:` or `did:cheqd:testnet:`)
5. `ISSUER_ID_METHOD_SPECIFIC_ID`: Unique identifier portion of a `did:cheqd` DID, e.g., `zAXwwqZzhCZA1L77ZBa8fhVNjL9MQCHX`
6. `ISSUER_ID`: Fully-qualified DID for the issuer, e.g., `did:cheqd:mainnet:zAXwwqZzhCZA1L77ZBa8fhVNjL9MQCHX`
7. `COSMOS_PAYER_MNEMONIC`: Mnemonic for the issuer's Cosmos account. This currently doesn't require any balances at the moment, but it required for the library to function.
8. `NETWORK_RPC_URL`: RPC URL for a node on cheqd network, e.g., `rpc.cheqd.net`
9. `AUTH0_SERVICE_ENDPOINT`: Auth0 service endpoint, is an instance of [Auth0 Service](https://github.com/cheqd/auth0-service)

### Run

Once configured, the app can be run using NPM:

```bash
npm start
```

Or, to build and run in Docker, use the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) provided.

```bash
docker build -t credential-service .
```
