## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

The purpose of this service is to issue and verify credentials. This service by itself does not take care of storing the credentials. If you'd like to store credentials, you would have to pair this service with [secret-box-service](https://github.com/cheqd/secret-box-service.git). This service is also dependent on [auth0-service](https://github.com/cheqd/auth0-service)

## üßë‚Äçüíªüõ† Developer Guide

### Setup

Dependencies can be installed using NPM or any other node package manager.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Configuration

The application expects the following environment variables to be defined for the app to function:

1. `ISSUER_ID_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX`: Hex-encoded private key to be used by the identity credential issuer
2. `ISSUER_ID_PUBLIC_KEY_HEX`: Hex-encoded public key to be used by the identity credential issuer
3. `ISSUER_ID`: Fully-qualified DID for the issuer, e.g., `did:cheqd:mainnet:zAXwwqZzhCZA1L77ZBa8fhVNjL9MQCHX`
4. `COSMOS_PAYER_MNEMONIC`: Mnemonic for the issuer's Cosmos account. This currently doesn't require any balances at the moment, but it required for the library to function.
5. `NETWORK_RPC_URL`: Optional RPC URL for a node on cheqd network, e.g., `rpc.cheqd.net`

### Run

Once configured, the app can be run using NPM:

```bash
npm start
```

Or, to build and run in Docker, use the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) provided.

```bash
docker build -t credential-service .
```
